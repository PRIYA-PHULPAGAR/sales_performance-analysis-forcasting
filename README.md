# Sales Performance Analysis & Forecasting

# Objective

This project aims to analyze historical sales data, identify trends, and forecast future sales using Time Series Analysis (ARIMA) and Machine Learning (Random Forest Regression). The analysis helps businesses make data-driven decisions, optimize inventory, and improve sales strategies.

# Dataset

The dataset contains sales data with the following key attributes:

* Date: Timestamp of recorded sales data.

* Total Sales: The total revenue generated on a given day.

# Installation & Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* pip install pandas matplotlib, seaborn ,statsmodels ,scikit-learn

# Usage

* Load the dataset using Pandas.

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize sales trends.

* Implement time series forecasting using ARIMA.

* Apply Machine Learning (Random Forest Regression) for sales prediction.

* Evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

# Key Features

* Sales Trend Analysis: Line plot to visualize historical sales trends.

* Time Series Forecasting: ARIMA model to predict future sales.

* Machine Learning Prediction: Random Forest Regression for predictive modeling.

* Performance Evaluation: Use MAE and MSE to assess model accuracy.

# Running the Notebook

Run the Jupyter Notebook step-by-step to execute the analysis:

jupyter notebook sales_performance_analysis_forecasting.ipynb

# Conclusion

This project provides insights into sales trends and future forecasts, enabling businesses to optimize inventory and enhance decision-making.
